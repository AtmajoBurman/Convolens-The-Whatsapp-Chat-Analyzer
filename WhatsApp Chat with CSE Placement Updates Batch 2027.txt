23/07/25, 8:39 am - Sravan Pudi: This is to remind all students who have received internship offers through on-campus placements that once an offer has been accepted, it is strictly prohibited to withdraw from it in favor of any off-campus opportunity.

Such actions not only breach the commitment made to the company but also severely damage the institute's relationship with the organization, potentially resulting in the company not returning for recruitment in future years.

*Any student found violating this will be blacklisted from the placement process.*

We urge you to act responsibly and respect the integrity of the campus placement system that benefits both you and your juniors in the long run. <This message was edited>

Inclusive Resume Format & details.

 Cisco is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to treating all its employees and job applicants equally, fairly and in accordance with the principles of social justice and mutual respect. We are creating a culture that promotes this inclusive selection process in which all candidates can participate and excel based on their skills and abilities. Student names and other primary details will be masked when the recruiter sends their resume to Cisco Interviewer to ensure that there is no bias or prejudice in the recruitment process. The students will be asked not to disclose any of these credentials during the interview and selection process. Cisco will evaluate the eligibility to join in the offered position purely based on knowledge and skills. We will only be collecting relevant information such as: University Project work, Internship/Work experience, Skills/Competencies, Github/Technical Portfolio, Achievements, and any extracurricular activities, from all candidates.

To eliminate any sort of conscious or unconscious bias and make the interview process fair to all we are asking you to send us your resume without any personal identifiers that need not be disclosed while assessing your skill.  Some of the things we want you to remove from your resume are:

1.        Name
2.        Contact details
3.        CGPA
4.        Previous educational institutions and associated scores (CGPA/percentage)
5.        References to any specific college-wise clubs, associations, or fests
6.        Languages known


To facilitate the process of editing your resumes into this format, we are attaching document, which is a sample for how the new inclusive resume (CC03) should look like.

Please find the candidate codes against the names mentioned in the above table. Use the same code to name the resumes and while joining the WebEx bridges for the interviews. (This is a mandatory process to appear for Cisco interviews).

13/01/26, 10:00 pm - Sravan Pudi: Due to unforeseen scheduling constraints, the TnP cell is unable to provide dedicated rooms for tomorrow's Accenture communication assessment. Kindly attempt the assessment from your respective hostel rooms in a quiet, distraction-free environment.
14/01/26, 1:11 pm - Sravan Pudi: Accenture has reported cheating instances during communication assessment if anymore instances are caught they are going to decrease the hiring count
14/01/26, 3:00 pm - Sravan Pudi: We have received a serious communication from Accenture regarding misconduct observed during the online recruitment process. It has been reported that some students were found carrying mobile phones and using external software/tools while appearing for the examination.
Accenture has clearly informed us that no further discrepancies will be tolerated. Any repetition of such unethical practices may compel them to block or discontinue their recruitment process at NIT Durgapur, which would be a significant loss for our institute and future students.
Despite being repeatedly instructed on several occasions to strictly follow the examination guidelines and maintain ethical conduct during online processes, such incidents are still occurring.
This is therefore to be treated as a FINAL WARNING to all students:
Do not bring mobile phones to the examination venue.
Do not use any external software, applications, or unfair means during online assessments.
Such irresponsible behaviour seriously damages the reputation and credibility of NIT Durgapur. The institute’s standing has been built over decades through discipline, integrity, and hard work, and it must not be compromised due to the actions of a few.
Students are expected to act responsibly and uphold the dignity of the institute. If the institute’s interests are ignored, the institute will also be compelled to reconsider its support for such individuals.
All students are advised to take this matter very seriously and ensure strict compliance with all guidelines henceforth.
